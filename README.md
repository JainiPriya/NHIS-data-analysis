# Analyzing NHIS Data to Investigate Healthcare Access, Mental Health, and Well-being in the United States

This project delves into healthcare access and mental health disparities in the U.S. using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. With a dataset of 27,651 samples, we leverage visualizations to uncover patterns, including the impact of ethnicity on access barriers and age-wise distribution of mental health issues. Key variables such as ethnicity, education, regions, drinking status, marital status, and mental health indicators are explored. Predictive analytics tasks focus on binary classification of mental health status and healthcare accessibility, utilizing logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines. Results aim to inform policymakers and practitioners, offering insights for targeted interventions and equitable healthcare access. This project showcases the power of analytics to address pressing public health challenges and advocate for inclusive healthcare services.
